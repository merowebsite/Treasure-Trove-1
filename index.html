            <p>Aayushree Acharya

                Aayushree Acharya, a 7th grader passionate about arts and animation shares her story with us. Above all her interests she enjoys ARTS AND ANIMATION the most. This young artist own her YouTube channel with amazing animated series and has huge fan followers and have been posting on it since. She shares that most of her inspirations are from internet sources and from her surroundings, and she enjoys digital art the most. She shares the secret that she love about art is the fact she can make entire worlds with just pen and paper- with a little bit of imagination, of course!
                
                She usually practice digital art in her free-time, when she get a stroke of inspiration, of when she has lots of things on her mind. Art helps her feel relaxed and believes it works with every other person too, and it makes her sure of what to do next.
                
                She is grateful for all the support from people around her, people who enjoy her creativity, and who are always willing to help. She says ,”My parents, teachers, and friends are the main reason I have never been afraid of showing my creativity, and I don't think I would have considered art a hobby if they hadn't supported me..”
